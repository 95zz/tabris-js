# Getting Started
Welcome to tabris.js, the framework for developing native apps in JavaScript. For getting started you should log in to https://tabrisjs.com. It provides you with documentation and integrates with the tabris.js App.

## Installing the tabris.js developer app
For the iOS app you will have to send us the UDID of your iOS device ([here is how you find it](http://whatsmyudid.com/)). We will move the new iOS TestFlight Beta service shortly. Please use [this form](https://tabrisjs.com/developer-apps) to send us the required information.

For Android simply use the Google play store.

## Explore
The tabris.js developer app comes pre-configured with several examples. These examples demonstrate the power and flexibility of tabris.js.

The examples are part of the tabris.js GitHub repository and are developed entirely in JavaScript. Checkout the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eclipsesource/tabris-js/tree/master/examples).

## The Developer Console
The tabris.js developer app ships with a developer console that can be used to track log messages, warnings and errors in the running tabris scripts. The console can be slid from the right side of the screen after you have clicked on an example or started a tabris script. The console provides functionality to filter messages, reload a script and much more.

After you have explored a script you may want to go back to the main tabris.js page. This can be achieved by pressing the **back** button on Android or the **home** button in the console pane on iOS.

Click the **link** button on the [snippets page](https://tabrisjs.com/examples/) add the script will show up under the _My Scripts_ tab on your device.
