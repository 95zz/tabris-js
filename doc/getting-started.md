The examples are part of the Tabris.js GitHub repository and are developed entirely in JavaScript. Checkout the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eclipsesource/tabris-js/tree/master/examples).

## The Developer Console
The Tabris.js developer app ships with a developer console that can be used to track log messages, warnings and errors in the running tabris scripts. The console can be slid from the right side of the screen after you have clicked on an example or started a tabris script. The console provides functionality to filter messages, reload a script and much more.

After you have explored a script you may want to go back to the main Tabris.js page. This can be achieved by pressing the **back** button on Android or the **home** button in the console pane on iOS.
