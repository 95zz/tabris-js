That is, the image will be displayed as large as possible while being fully contained in the view.\n- `fill` will scale the image proportionally to fill the entire view, possibly cutting off parts of the image. That is, the image will be displayed as small as possible while covering the entire view.\n- `auto` will scale *down* the image to *fit* into the view if it is too large, but it won't scale up a smaller image.\n- `stretch` will resize the image to the actual bounds of the image view.\n- `none` will not resize the image at all. The image will be displayed in its original size."
