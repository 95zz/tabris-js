Using the demo
==============
Before using the demo the required node modules should be first installed:
```bash
npm install restify save
```
The node server should be started:
```bash
node server.js
```
Then the server address placeholders in the `urlRoot` and the `url` properties
in `TodoItem.js` and `TodoList.js` respectively should be replaced by the IP
address of the running node server.
