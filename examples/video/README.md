# Video example

tabris.js exposes the native video widgets of the supported mobile platforms. This example demonstrates how to set up and control a video widget with your own controls. It also listens to events that are fired when the built-in controls of the video players are used and toggles the custom controls accordingly.

_The API of the video widget is provisional and subject to change._
